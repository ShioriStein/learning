There are 4 ways Authentication:
1. Basic Authentication: Basic authentication is a simple authentication method that involves sending a user’s credentials (username and password) in plain text with each request.
    This method is easy to implement but not very secure since the credentials can be intercepted and read by third parties.

2. Form-based Authentication: Form-based authentication is a more secure authentication method that uses a login form to collect user credentials.
    The user enters their username and password into the form, which is then sent to the server for verification. This method is widely used and easy to implement.

3. Token-based Authentication: Token-based authentication is a popular authentication method that involves generating a token (usually a JSON web token or JWT) that is sent to the client after successful authentication.
    The client includes the token with each subsequent request to access protected resources. This method is stateless, scalable, and secure.

4. OAuth2: OAuth2 is an open standard for authentication and authorization that allows users to grant third-party applications access to their resources without giving away their credentials.
    This method is widely used and supported by many popular applications and services.


Pros and Cons of each authentication:
Basic Authentication:
    Pros:
    Simplicity: Basic authentication is easy to implement and requires minimal configuration.
    Compatibility: Basic authentication is supported by most web browsers and HTTP clients, making it a widely used authentication method.
    Serverless: Basic authentication does not require the use of a server-side session or cookies, which makes it a good fit for stateless applications or APIs.

    Cons:
    Not very secure: Basic authentication sends credentials in plain text, which can be intercepted and read by third parties. This makes it vulnerable to man-in-the-middle attacks.
    No protection against CSRF: Basic authentication does not provide protection against cross-site request forgery (CSRF) attacks.
    No support for multifactor authentication: Basic authentication does not support multifactor authentication, which can provide an additional layer of security.
    Passwords stored in plain text: Basic authentication stores passwords in plain text, which is a security risk if the database is compromised.

Form Authentication:
    Pros:
    User-friendly: Form-based authentication is easy to use, and users are familiar with the login form interface, making it simple to authenticate users.
    Customizable: Websites can customize their login forms to match their branding and design, providing a seamless user experience.
    Centralized control: The website’s server controls the authentication process, allowing for centralized management and control of user accounts and access.
    Session management: The session tokens generated by form-based authentication allow for session management, which means users don’t have to enter their credentials repeatedly for each request.

    Cons:
    Security risks: Form-based authentication is vulnerable to attacks such as phishing, SQL injection, cross-site scripting (XSS), and man-in-the-middle attacks, making it less secure than other authentication methods.
    Credential reuse: If a user reuses their username and password across multiple websites, a data breach on one site can lead to the compromise of their credentials on other sites.
    Password strength: Passwords are the primary method of authentication in form-based authentication, and weak passwords can be easily compromised.
    User error: Users may inadvertently enter incorrect credentials, leading to denied access and account lockout.

Token Authentication:
    Pros:
    Stateless: Token-based authentication is stateless, meaning that it doesn’t require the server to maintain session information, simplifying server architecture and reducing server load.
    Scalable: Token-based authentication is scalable, as tokens can be easily distributed across multiple servers, allowing for horizontal scaling of applications.
    Cross-platform: Tokens can be used across multiple platforms and devices, making it easier to implement cross-platform applications.
    Single sign-on (SSO): Token-based authentication can be used to implement single sign-on (SSO) for multiple web applications, making it easier for users to access multiple applications with a single set of credentials.

    Cons:
    Complexity: Token-based authentication can be more complex to implement than other authentication methods, requiring additional effort to generate and validate tokens.
    Storage: Tokens need to be stored somewhere, typically in a cookie or local storage on the client’s device, which can be a security risk if not done correctly.
    Security risks: Token-based authentication is vulnerable to attacks such as token theft and replay attacks, making it less secure than some other authentication methods.
    Token expiration: If tokens have a short expiration time, it can be frustrating for users who need to repeatedly re-authenticate to access protected resources
