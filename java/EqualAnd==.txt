equals method:
This is a method defined in the Object class.
The .equals() Method is present in the Object class, so we can override our custom .equals() method in the custom class, for objects comparison.
This method is used for checking the equality of contents between two objects as per the specified business logic.

==
It is a binary operator in Java.
It cannot be modified. They always compare the HashCode.
This operator is used for comparing addresses (or references), i.e checks if both the objects are pointing to the same memory location.

Note:
In the cases where the equals method is not overridden in a class, then the class uses the default implementation of the equals method that is closest to the parent class.
Object class is considered as the parent class of all the java classes. The implementation of the equals method in the Object class uses the == operator to compare two objects. This default implementation can be overridden as per the business logic.
