1.
In Java every object is reference.
Except from primitive variable.
Java use pointer internally.

 Java is not a pure object-oriented programming language, because it has direct access to primitive data types. And these primitive data types don't directly belong to the Integer classes.

 2.Java is pass-by-value or pass-by-reference
 Java always pass-by-value
 But when you pass the object to method, what you are passing is reference to the address of object.
