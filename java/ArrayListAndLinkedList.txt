Structure:
Array list is a dynamic array
It store data and using index to point to the node of data.
LinkedList is a collection of nodes.
It contains 3 part: pointer to previous node, data, pointer to the next node.

Data access:
data access in Array list is very fast since you just need to access through the index.
Data access in Linked List is slower since you will to traverse along the list.

Insert & Delete:
Array List: Slower since you have to re-index everytime for each insert/remove.
Linked List: very fast since you just need to update the previous and next pointer.

Memory usage:
Array List: Smaller, it only need memory for array of items and indexes
Linked List: Bigger, it contain data, previous and next pointer.

Best case usage:
Array List: For updating and reading
Linked List: For insert and removal
