Volatile work according to Before-Happen rule.
It guarantees your value visibility in multithreading so that your order doesn't change.
When you write to volatile variables, every write happen before the very action nof writing into volatile will be flush and update to memory.
When you read volatile variables, any non-volatile variable that the thread can see show be update with value from memory.
Ex:


nonVolatile1 = 1;
nonVolatile2 = 2;
volatile1 = ready; -> nonVolatile1, nonVolatile2 will be updated to memory       while(volatile1 != ready); -> will read new value from memory
                                                                                 println(nonVolatile1);
