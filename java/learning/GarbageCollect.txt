GC is a way for Java to free memory from unused object.

1. way to free object
 > Set the object references to null once the object creation purpose is served.
    Ex: String s1 = "smth";
    s1 = null; -> make s1 eligible for GC

 > Point the reference variable to another object. Doing this, the object which the reference variable was referencing before becomes eligible for GC.
 Ex: String s1= "smth1";
     String s2= "smth2";
     s1=s2:

     "smth1" -> eligible for Gc

 > Island of Isolation Approach: When 2 reference variables pointing to instances of the same class,
   and these variables refer to only each other and the objects pointed by these 2 variables don't have any other references,
   then it is said to have formed an “Island of Isolation” and these 2 objects are eligible for GC.

   Ex:

   Class A {
       A a;
       main(String[] str) {
             A a1 = new A();
             A a2 = new A();
             a1.a = a2;
             a2.a = a1;

             a1 = null;
             a2 = null;

              // We see that a1 and a2 objects refer
              // to only each other and have no valid
              // references- these 2 objects for island of isolcation - eligible for GC
       }
   }
