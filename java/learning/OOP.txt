4 principles of OOP:
1. Encapsulation
    - Technique of making state of object private.
    - Class can change the degree of access through the use of public methods
2. Inheritance
    - Allow you to build a class upon an exist class.
    - Child class can inherit attributes and methods from one class to another.
    - Important to note: Inheritance is not about hierarchy but about re-using code.
3. Polymorphimsm
    - A method can be executed through different way.
    - Overload and Overriding
    - Overloading: Same method name but different parameter.
    - Overriding: Override a method that declare in parent and child class. IF the child doesn't declare then use the parent's method.

4. Abstraction
    - Hide the implementation and only show the public method.
    - Abstract class and abstract
