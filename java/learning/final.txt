final variable:
- Final and its value can't be modified once assigned. It can only be assigned once (either during declaration or inside constructor).
- If not value has been assigned to it, then it can be assigned only by the constructor of the class.

final method:
- a method declare as final can not be overridden by its child's class
- a constructor cannot be marked as final because whenever a class is inherited, the constructors are not inherited.

final class:
- No classes can be inherited from the class declared as final. But that final class can extend other classes for its usage.


 is because abstract classes are incomplete classes that need to be inherited for making their concrete classes. so combine abstract adn final are not allowed
