ACID principles:
- Atomicity: Entire transaction success or none at all
    > Abort : If a transaction aborts, changes made to the database are not visible.
    > Commit : If a transaction commits, changes made are visible.
- Consistency: integrity constraints must be maintained so that the database is consistent before and after the transaction.
- Isolation: multiple transactions can occur concurrently without leading to the inconsistency of the database state
- Durability: the updates and modifications to the database are stored in and written to disk and they persist even if a system failure occurs
